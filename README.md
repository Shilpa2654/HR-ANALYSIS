## Project Objective:
The Primary goal of my HR analytics Project was to delve into employee attrition trends within an organisation by leveraging data. I aimed to uncover patterns and factors that contribute to attrition rates.
## Data set used:
- <a href="https://github.com/Shilpa2654/HR-ANALYSIS/blob/main/HR_Analytics.csv">HR analysis data</a>
## Questions (KPIs):
1. How many Employees are there in the company?
2. What is the attrition count?
3. Calculate the attrition rate.
4. Which age group got the highest attrition count?
5. Compare attrition by Gender.
6. Attrition by Years at Company.
7. Attrition by Education.
8. Dashboard interaction - <a href="https://github.com/Shilpa2654/HR-ANALYSIS/blob/main/HR%20DASHBOARD.png">Report</a> .
## Process:

## Project insight:
- Age group of 26-35 are more likely to leave the company.
- Employees having low salary (below 5k) not satisfied with payment so left the company.
- Compare to male and female most of the male (140) leave the company.
- There is a 16.12% of attrition rate of the company.
